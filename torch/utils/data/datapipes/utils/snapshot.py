# TODO: Caveats
#   1. Caller (either the ReadingService or DataLoader) must pass in the initial RNG
#   2. `in_batch_shuffle` and `bucketbatch` are not compatible with this because they currently
#      lack the option to `set_seed`.

def _simple_snapshot_graph(datapipe: IterDataPipe, n_iterations: int, rng=None) -> None:
    r"""
    This function will restore a snapshot by fast-forwarding the given DataPipe by ``n_iterations``,
    and in the process, fast-forward its parent DataPipes as well at the cost of re-doing every computation.
    For instance, applying this function to the final DataPipe of a graph will restore the snapshot
    (via fast-forward) every DataPipe within the graph.

    Note:
        This is the simplest but least efficient way to fast-forward a DataPipe. Usage of other fast-forwarding
        methods (custom ones if necessary) are recommended.

    Args:
        datapipe: IterDataPipe to be fast-forwarded
        n_iterations: number of iterations to fast-forward
        rng: ``Optional[torch.Generator]``. If not ``None``, this RNG will be used for shuffling. The generator
            should be in its `initial` state as it was first passed into ``DataLoader`` or ``ReadingService``.
